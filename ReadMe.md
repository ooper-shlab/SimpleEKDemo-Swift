# SimpleEKDemo


## DESCRIPTION:
+ This sample shows how to use EventKit and EventKitUI frameworks to check and request access to the userâ€™s Calendar database. It also shows how to access and edit calendar data in the Calendar database.

+ The application uses table views to display EKEvent objects retrieved from an EKEventStore object. It implements EKEventViewController for viewing and editing existing EKEvents, and uses EKEventEditViewController for creating new EKEvents.

+ Amongst the techniques shown are how to:
* Check and request access to the Calendar database.
* Create and initialize an event store object.
* Create a predicate, or a search query for the Calendar database.
* Override EKEventEditViewDelegate method to respond to editing events.
* Access event store, calendar and event properties.
